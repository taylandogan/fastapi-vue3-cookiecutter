# fastapi-vue3-cookiecutter
A cookiecutter template that generates a fastapi-vue3 project.
Optionally you might add a PostgreSQL database and Docker support.

### How to use it

Go to the directory where you want to create your project and run:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/taylandogan/fastapi-vue3-cookiecutter
```

### Generate passwords

You will be asked to provide passwords and secret keys for several components. Open another terminal and run:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```


### Input variables

The generator (cookiecutter) will ask you for some data, you might want to have at hand before generating the project.

The input variables, with their default values (some auto generated) are:

* `project_name`: The name of the project
* `project_slug`: The development friendly name of the project. By default, based on the project name

* `docker_swarm_stack_name_main`: The name of the stack while deploying to Docker in Swarm mode for production. By default, based on the domain.
* `docker_swarm_stack_name_staging`: The name of the stack while deploying to Docker in Swarm mode for staging. By default, based on the domain.

* `secret_key`: Backend server secret key. Use the method above to generate it.
* `first_superuser`: The first superuser generated, with it you will be able to create more users, etc. By default, based on the domain.
* `first_superuser_password`: First superuser password. Use the method above to generate it.
* `backend_cors_origins`: Origins (domains, more or less) that are enabled for CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing). This allows a frontend in one domain (e.g. `https://dashboard.example.com`) to communicate with this backend, that could be living in another domain (e.g. `https://api.example.com`). It can also be used to allow your local frontend (with a custom `hosts` domain mapping, as described in the project's `README.md`) that could be living in `http://dev.example.com:8080` to communicate with the backend at `https://stag.example.com`. Notice the `http` vs `https` and the `dev.` prefix for local development vs the "staging" `stag.` prefix. By default, it includes origins for production, staging and development, with ports commonly used during local development by several popular frontend frameworks (Vue with `:8080`, React, Angular).

* `postgres_password`: Postgres database password. Use the method above to generate it. (You could easily modify it to use MySQL, MariaDB, etc).
* `pgadmin_default_user`: PGAdmin default user, to log-in to the PGAdmin interface.
* `pgadmin_default_user_password`: PGAdmin default user password. Generate it with the method above.

* `docker_image_prefix`: Prefix to use for Docker image names. If you are using GitLab Docker registry it would be based on your code repository. E.g.: `git.example.com/development-team/my-awesome-project/`.
* `docker_image_backend`: Docker image name for the backend. By default, it will be based on your Docker image prefix, e.g.: `git.example.com/development-team/my-awesome-project/backend`. And depending on your environment, a different tag will be appended ( `prod`, `stag`, `branch` ). So, the final image names used will be like: `git.example.com/development-team/my-awesome-project/backend:prod`.

* `docker_image_frontend`: Docker image for the frontend. By default, based on your Docker image prefix.
